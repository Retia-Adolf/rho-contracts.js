== Possibly Bad Error Messages

1. When giving an object contract as an argument to .extend, should complain

2. When refactoring the arguments of a function and forgetting to also rename the arguments in the
   contract, should complains. Use `function(){}.toString` to discover the declared names of the 
   function's arguments.
